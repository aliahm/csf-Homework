Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

When I commented out seq = "" and linenum = 0, the program didnt run becasue it had an error. Its said to Traceback to the line it
had an error in. Every varible needs to have a value or python wouldn't know what to do with the variable. When I commented out the varibles
they became undifined.

When I commented out gc_count = 0, the program didnt run becasue it had an error. Its said to Traceback to the line it
had an error in. Every varible needs to have a value or python wouldn't know what to do. When I commented out what the varibale value
was it became undifined.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7

Collaboration:
I received help from Jessica Morton (Classmate) and Kahea (Tutor).


Reflection:
I learned that every variable needs a value in order to run the program. I wish this assignment was written more better its was really 
confusing because of to much wording and would jump around from problem to problem.
