#Problem 3 (What is Assert doing?)

a = 5
b = 5

assert a == b

# The code is giving me nothing becasue assert checks if the values of the
#variables are equal, and a and b are equal.

b = 10

#assert a == b

# I commented out the assert above so I can run the rest of my problems.

#It is giving an assertion error beacuse they don't equal now.

# Problem 4 (Defining a function and calling a function)

c = 2

def dv(a, b, c): return float(a*b)/c

print dv(a, b, c)

# Problem 5  (What is the differences of Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries)

names = ("David", "Lin", "Harden", "Bryant")

ages = ( 5, 6, 3, 8)

Number = { "Mother": 2065557777 }

print names, ages, Number


#Problem 6 (Creating nested list and accessing lists)

list_a = [ 1, 2, 3]
list_b = [ 2, 3, 1]

list_c = []

for i in range (len(list_a)):
    list_c.append(list_a[i] + list_b[i])
    
print list_c

#Problem 7 (for loop)

fruit_list = ["apple", "orange", "pear"]

for i in fruit_list:
        print i
